# Homework Assignment Week 14:
### Eat-Da-Burger!

This repository is for the week 14 homework assignment for University of Miami Coding Bootcamp. 

A Burger Eatin' Application With Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars/Materialize

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end built using HTML, CSS, Handlebars and Bootstrap and a backend implemented with Node.js, MySQL and Express. 

## How to Play:
The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking "Devour it", which moves it below to the "All Gone" section.
