# Homework Assignment Week 14:
### Eat-Da-Burger!

This repository is for the week 14 homework assignment for University of Miami Coding Bootcamp. 

This restaurant application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end built using HTML, CSS, Handlebars and Bootstrap and a back end implemented with Node.js, MySQL and Express. 

## How to Play:
1. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page - waiting to be devoured. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. 

2. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. 

3. The user may then eat any burger by clicking "Devour it", which moves it below to the "All Gone" section.
The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
