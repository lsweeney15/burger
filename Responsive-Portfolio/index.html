      <p><strong>Liam Sweeney</strong> was born in New Haven, Connecticut to a family that – wonderful as they may be – couldn’t draw a straight line with a ruler. Shocked by Liam’s early drawings, his parents first made sure there hadn’t been a switch at the hospital, and then encouraged him to develop and explore his artistic inclinations. He’s been doing so ever since.</p>

      <p>Liam moved to Florida, having decided to attend the University of Miami, when he was 18. He found university life, as well as the culturally rich city at its gate, to be a bottomless sources of inspiration. He graduated with a B.A. in Graphic Design in May of 2009.</p>

      <p>Now 30, Liam is becoming one of the go-to creative professionals in South Florida. He is available for freelance work. He specialized in branding and hospitality design.</p>
